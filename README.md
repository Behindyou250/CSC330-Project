# CSC-330 Final Project - Pokedex
Includes the Source Files, Pictures, All the CSV Datasets, UML Diagram, and the Presentation.

## Notes
- Currently, it is not possible to change CSV Files and Pictures inside the program, only through command line.
- Due to weird issues in BoxLayout, List View for any of the Views sits weirdly in the middle and goes to top with refreshes.
